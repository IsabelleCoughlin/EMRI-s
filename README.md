# EMRI-s
Code concerning EMRI signal noise studies

Keplerian-Copy1.ipbyn contains current progress on calculating the SNR values for evolving EMRI system. 

-> Consistent geometric units have been implemented
-> Evolving the keplerian equations until about 10 schwarzchild radii and then transitioning to the post-newtonian equations until plunge. 

Questions: 

How does one correctly mix the pre and post transition evolutions?
